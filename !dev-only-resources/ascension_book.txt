It might actually be able to get me there. It\'ll all be worth it. It opened, but wasn\'t focused. Incomprehensible, but something was there. In other news, the pipes are being tested now with water. It\'s similar enough."]]','[["Day Four\\n\\nThe engineers have figured out how to channel the power we need into the system, now it\'s just a point of getting our power souce. The first group of converts will arrive tomorrow."]]','[["Day Five\\n\\nThe torches have been lit for the first arrival ceremony. The people are excited.

Years of work will all pay off in the coming weeks."]]','[["Day Eight\\n\\nWe\'re making preperations for the first group to go into the prison.

People are panicking but it doesn\'t matter, we\'ve gone very blunt, which we planned, just not this soon."]]','[["I suppose I should explain why the draining is so important. Many years ago after the incident, I awoke to the fact that blood can be used to power a form of magic. I saw it used to open the rift that I saw that day.
