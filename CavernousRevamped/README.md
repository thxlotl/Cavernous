# CAVERNOUS

Cavernous is a datapack that overhauls the caves in minecraft by adding a
multitude of different biomes and features. I hope you enjoy it and I hope
it adds to your mining and crafting experience!

# IF YOU ARE UPDATING A LEGACY VERSION (1.6.3.2 and earlier)

If you are updating this datapack in a world that has used version 1.6.3.2
or earlier, go into the root of this datapack and drag the "cavernous" and
"minecraft" folders into the "data" folder and then install the datapack as
you would normally.
