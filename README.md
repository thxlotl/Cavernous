## CAVERNOUS
Cavernous adds many new biomes and depth to the caves of minecraft.

## GEYSER DISCLAIMER
If you are using Cavernous on a server, you must have command blocks enabled. This is only
so the geysers can generate and does not give anyone access to command blocks. You can do
this by going to the server.properties file and setting "enable-command-block" to true.

You also cannot use other datapacks that unlock all recipes since it breaks certain features.
An alternative datapack can be found here: https://wasdbuildteam.website/data-packs/unlock-all-recipes/

## UPDATING FROM OLD CAVERNOUS VERSION

In order to update from a version released before Minecraft 1.20, you must delete the old
Cavernous datapack in your world's datapack folder and then put in the new datapack (the
one this read me belongs to) and drag the "CavernousCompatibility.zip" from the same folder
into the datapack folder as well. You only have to do this once, every other time you upgrade
to a new version the compatibility pack will still work.
